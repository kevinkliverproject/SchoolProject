          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">It is no longer a secret that plastic is one of the biggest problems for our environment and ourselves. In this blog post we would like to show you the fatal effects of plastic and what we can make better.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The amount of plastic waste, especially in the oceans, is unpleasant. There are more than 100 million tons floating in the oceans. If nothing changes, there will be more plastic than animals in the ocean in a few years. Plastic cannot be broken down by nature. Microorganisms cannot decompose plastic, as it is a purely chemical product. In fact, only ocean water and wind can decompose plastic waste very slowly. However, that also takes a long time. A plastic bag takes about 20 years to turn into microplastic. However, the garbage never goes away completely and ends up as microparticles in marine animals and in turn in our bodies through fishing. This is not only damaging the oceans through species extinction, pollution and the destruction of natural areas. Human health also suffers as a result.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There are now many voluntary and political campaigns and projects in the fight against plastic waste. There are also some alternatives to plastic packaging.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">There are now several voluntary actions and associations of people who clean beaches and seas.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Also, some to-go outlets, supermarkets, restaurants or cafes offer a discount if you bring your own cans, cups or boxes of food and drinks. Politicians are trying to use initiatives and projects to raise people's awareness, to draw attention to correct disposal and to promote more biodegradable plastic.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In addition, from 2021, single-use plastic products such as straws and cotton swabs will be banned in the EU. There should then be alternative products made of recyclable material.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">The sale of plastic bags at the checkout has been banned since 2022, so that more and more reusable bags and paper bags have to be used.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">We too can help to avoid plastic in everyday life and make the world a little healthier! Plastics have a fixed place in our modern living environment - be it as packaging material for food or "invisible" in the form of microplastics in cosmetics. But it is not that difficult to avoid plastic and ensure more sustainability.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">1. Remove superfluous disposable products from everyday life</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Plastic plates and cutlery, drinking straws. They are only for one-time use, harm the environment and cost something too</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: use reusable crockery or only offer drinks and snacks that do not require the use of plastic. If you are too lazy to wash up after the party, you can ask the drink supplier for glasses. In fact, many offer the delivery of glasses and even the washing up afterwards as a service.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">2.Shops</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Supermarkets and discounters: As a customer, you often hardly have a chance to buy unpackaged groceries here. The product is often wrapped in a lot of plastic.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: If possible, support "unpackaged" shops. In many cities there are already such types of shops where you can simply fill up containers you have brought with you.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">3. Reusable carrying bags</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Disposable carrier bags: whether they are made of plastic or paper. Fortunately, plastic and paper bags are now much less available at supermarket checkouts in Germany, or only for an extra charge.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: Reusable carrier bags are often offered in stores. It is best to bring your own backpack or shopping bag with you from home for shopping.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">4. Fruits and vegetables</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Fruit and vegetables in plastic foil: The fruit is quickly put in the small, transparent plastic bag because you want to put the purchase on the conveyor belt unharvested. Even organic fruit is often shrink-wrapped in plastic film in the supermarket. It's easy to sweat when you're shopping in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: Usually the plastic around it is completely unnecessary, because fruits and vegetables often have their own protective cover or simply have to be washed well.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">5. Reusable instead of one-way</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Disposable beverage bottles and cans: Quickly grabbed at a snack bar to quench thirst, but they also quickly create a waste problem.Alternative:&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Basically, returnable bottles are generally more environmentally friendly than the one-way version. But the matter is complicated: reusable bottles made of glass are only more environmentally friendly than those made of plastic if they have not been transported long distances. The best thing is to always have your own bottle of water with you.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">6. “Stay” instead of “Go”</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Coffee and food to go: who doesn't know that? Get a cup of coffee on the go or take the food to go instead of eating on the spot.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: Almost all shops accept reusable cups or cans that you bring with you. In many cafés, the commitment to the environment is even rewarded and the coffee in a reusable cup costs less. Or if possible just take the time and have a coffee in the café.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">7. Pay attention to ingredients in cosmetics</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Liquid soap, scrubs, shower gel or mascara: microplastics are hidden in many of these products - under various names. The small particles can hide behind designations such as polyethylene (PE) or polyquaternium (PQ). Liquid synthetic polymers, i.e. substances that are difficult to degrade in the environment, can also be hidden in cosmetics.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: Certified natural cosmetics do not contain any petroleum-based ingredients. Solid soap can also be a good alternative for personal hygiene. Shampoo and conditioner are also available in soap form. Coffee grounds, sugar or sea salt can be used for scrubs. And the most important thing: Pay attention to the ingredients when buying cosmetics and read the fine print.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">9. Separate garbage</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Waste separation can be a small contribution with a big impact in every household.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Waste incineration generates greenhouse gases: If all the garbage ends up in the same garbage can, it is incinerated as residual waste and generates greenhouse gases. Recycling can also be energy-intensive, but it's still better because it reuses raw materials such as plastic and metal.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: Even if it is sometimes tedious in everyday life: consistent waste separation makes sense.</p>
          <p id="isPasted" style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">10. Collect rubbish</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Plastic waste in the sea: On the beach, on the lake, on the river bank - plastic waste in nature is a sad sight and yet omnipresent. Much of our waste ends up in the stomachs of fish, whales and seabirds.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Alternative: roll up your sleeves and collect rubbish! Each piece of garbage that is collected can no longer clog an animal's stomach. At campaign days, where many people collect rubbish, you also get to know nice people.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Of course here are measures that are more extreme than others. But you also can do something lesser than others, just start tot hink about it.</p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
